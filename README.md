# A-Survey-on-ITPs-in-Large-Scale-Formal-Verification

Interactive theorem proving (ITP) systems let human and machine work together to build machinechecked formal proofs. Different ITP systems has emerged following different formal foundations of
mathematics with their own set of interesting features. These systems are now being widely used in formal verification of large-scale complex systems to increase their reliability, leading to equally large-scale
proof development. Consequently, the focus of proof assistant research has been expanded to practical aspects of ITP systems to identify and address domain-specific challenges in large-scale development.
This survey organizes existing research on these practical aspects, along with a brief overview of interactive theorem proving systems themselves. It also draws attention to significant challenges and open
problems identified by the researchers across literature.
